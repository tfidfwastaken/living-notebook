◊(define-meta title "Newsless.")

The world presented by the news is not the world you live in. It's just a subset of the world, consisting of events cherry-picked to trigger a strong response in your brain. Shock, fear, and outrage.

Read these headlines, and notice how your brain "perks up":

News websites and newspapers earn money by grabbing your attention (and personal data), and selling it to advertisers.

That means the only thing that newspapers ever really need to worry about to sustain themselves as a business is to do whatever it takes to get your eyeballs on them.

While I was doing my research to find typical news headlines, I opened my country's most popular English newspaper. After skipping an advertisement that shows up before you enter the homepage I was greeted with this atrocity.

◊img[#:src "images/toi_wants_attention.jpg" #:alt "TOI wants attention"]

Notice how everything on this website is desperately and shamelessly fighting to extract my attention. It asks me permission to let them distract me with notifications so I can visit their website more often.

There is a bar at the bottom giving me points for every day visited, complete with streak bonuses. These points can be redeemed for offers with their partners. A good deal for those who haven't yet measured the value their scarce attention and mental well being against a ₹1000 off on the Corseca Nector Stereo Bluetooth Neckband.

News is not about keeping you informed about the world. It's making you ◊em{feel} like you are informed about the world. To almost everyone, news has little to no value, and your life will be better off without it.

Here's what helped me put it into perspective---will you read a book which consists of all the news articles compiled over the last year? Will you even read half of it?

I would not. None of the information in such a book would have aged particularly well, nor would it be accurate. Most of it would be chaff. I'd rather read a book.

Yet somehow most people are perfectly okay with being given daily doses of information that is of no use to them.

◊heading{News makes you less informed and more narrow-minded}

A person is a product of input.

◊sn{I am not taking the extreme stance of a person being ◊em{only} a product of their environment, but environment does play a significant role in determining personality. I'll leave the verification of this statement as an exercise for the reader.}

If news is the input that informs my world view, then the world to me will be the News World, as opposed to the Real World. The News World is a very dramatic world with evil corrupt politicians and people you may have heard of slinging feces at each other, murders on every street corner, terrorist attacks and threats of war.

The Real World is vastly larger than the News World. It's so vast that nobody can really be "informed" or "up to date" with it. Who is accounting for every bill passed in every country, every human life in every neighbourhood, every person lifted out of poverty, and every solution to reducing CO₂ emissions? What about every discovery made in the sciences, every breakthrough in improving our quality of life, and every setback that makes our lives worse, that we do not know of yet?

Trying to "be informed" is a fruitless undertaking. 

If you want to become a wholesome person who understands the world better, stop reading the news. Or at the very least, treat it for what it is---entertainment that is loosely based on real events.

There is a refreshing consequence to this. Since you cannot be informed about everything, you can choose what you want to be informed about. Control your inputs, and you change the way you view the world.

Mind you, I am not advocating deluding yourself. Just reframe things, and interpret reality in a way that is useful and brings you satisfaction.

◊heading{I hate the news, but I don't hate journalism}

News is not the same as journalism. News just reports events happening around, and at best, analyzes them in a reactionary way. Good journalism helps you make sense of the world and teaches you something new. This takes time, effort and hindsight. News is journalism at its worst, as it constrains the quality and accuracy in order to be fast. The faster and shorter the news, the worse it is in quality, and the more interested it is in generating outrage.

◊sn{This is why news reporting on the internet and television are the worst. Weekly magazines tend to be somewhat better, but still not slow and boring enough to be objective and great.}

◊heading{Alternatives to the news}

If you are interested in topics that show up on newspapers often, read books about them. Pick what ◊em{you} like. Don't let an algorithm feed you what makes them money.
